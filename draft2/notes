1.user requests http://localhost/home
2.web.py delivers the home page via render()
3.browser draws the home page html, and processes any onload() javascript
4.(page is now idle, waiting for user interaction)
5.user clicks something, javascript function evaluates what was clicked and decides to request more data
6.javascript creates and issues an XmlHttpRequest (or in jQuery... $.ajax() )
7.web.py handles the request, let's say it was to /home_tab_2 (web.py doesn't care whether or not this is an ajax request or a traditional page request... doesn't matter... it's just a different url handler)
8.your handler will most likely build some html or json data (your tab content) to send back
9.in the browser, javascript receives the response content from the request
10.javascript updates the page (with element.innerHTML() or in jquery $(element).append() or whatever)
